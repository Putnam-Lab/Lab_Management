**_Things to know_**
- This tutorial provides basic information and tips for good practices.
- **Always check with your supervisor/PI for specific policies and practices pertaining to the research.**
- **Notebooks must remain in the lab, as they are funded by research sponsors and considered official records of the project**.
- Having a well documented notebook helps for replication and validation of the research conducted in the lab.

### 1. Introduction to the laboratory notebook
_What is a Laboratory Notebook?_

- It provides a permanent written record of procedures, reagents, data, calculations, thoughts, explanations, and results of experiments. 
- The records helps to intepret, evaluate and analyze data from the experiments which creates foundation of thesis and publications. 
- The key to having a good notebook is having clear layout, descriptions and being specific with your writing.



 ### 2. Choosing a Laboratory Notebook

I. Paper laboratory notebooks with following characteristics make up the best kind.
 - With hard cover and stitched binding
 - Pages are numbered and not dettachable
 - Durable for a long time

II. If you choose to have a electronic lab notebook (ELN) or prefer a combination of both paper and electronic, consider the following practices:
- Strong ability to take clear and organized notes
- Easily accessible for quick reference
- Includes data and image files for detailed documentation
- Ability to export to a common file type like PDF.
- (Add more)

 ### 3. Naming your Laboratory Notebook
 _Significance: It is helpful for identification and for referencing collected data by the owner_

 - Check with your PI if the lab already has an established naming codes
 - Use of name and inititals are some of the most common practice carried out by researchers.
 - Assigning alphabetic code or a specific numeric for each lab member or to a notbeooks they 
   use could be implemented. Look at the example below:

| Notebook Number | Personnel | Project Contents | Start Date | End Date | Electronic Archives | Notes |
|:------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 1 | Scient

(Add Image of a sample notebook nomenclature) 

- Label with your full name on the front page of the notebook and if binded also label the spine
- If multiple notebooks are used, each one could be identified by standard or Roman numberals.
- Indicate the start and end date of the notebook.
- Specify if the notebook is been  used for a particular project

 ### 4. Components of a Laboratory Notebook
I. Nomenclature of the notebook: Contains the name of the owner with dates and project that the notebook is being used for.

II. Table of Contents:
- Make your own if the content page is not provided
- Each experiment should have the title and date when it is conducted
- If the multiple experiments are simultaneously carried out make sure to put correct page numbers on the content page so it is accessible and clear to anyone using it for reference.

III. Practices for documenting experimental records
- Clear objective and purpose of the experiment
- Outlining or flow diagram of the experiment
- Detailed procedure following step by step demonstrations that includes the requirements of the 
  experiments
- Be specific if you are following a protocol and making alterations based on the experiment.
- Include all your observations and thoughts during the planning and excecution of the experiment
- Write down all the different data types as well as transcribed data in a clear format.
    -Some of the types of data types include:
    1. Raw Data: Contains original information that includes handwritten notes and print outs 
       depicting the results.
    2. Calculated Data: Data generated as a result of any calculation. Do not forget to include 
       the formulas or equations used to get those numbers.
    3. Transcribed Data: This type of data is generally copied from any source. Please include          original location of the copy.
- If you are using any abbrevations make sure you define those whenever in use, at the base 
  of the page or the notebook can have designated pages for abbrevations.
- Indicate if the observations followed the project hypotheses or include any deviations if there are any. This is also a great space to add your questions as well as any suggestions you think might work for deviations. 
- Supplemental documents
   1. Include any prinouts/forms in the notebook with the help of a glue/tape so it remains 
     intact and exposed. Ask your PI if there are any set rules for such documents
   2. There are times when you collect a lot of data at one time. Hence, use of additional 
   notebooks or three ring binders could be essentials for storing those hard copies.
- General Notebook Maintenance
   1. Use an ink pen for writing
   2. Make it a habit to write as you follow the procedure. The likelihood of making an error 
      increases, especially if the mistake goes unnoticed until the end.
   3. Record entries on consecutive pages. Do not leave blank pages; clearly mark any unused 
      pages. Removing pages is not recommended.
   4. If you made an error, use a single line to cancel it out followed by writing the correct 
      information.
   5. Always date the experimental entries and begin new entries on a new page, especially if 
      they are not done on the same day.
      
IV. OWNERSHIP & RIGHTS
- As a owner of the notebook, make sure your entries align with the objectives of the lab, your 
  PI and the organization you work along.
- **Notebooks must remain in the lab, as they are funded by research sponsors and considered 
  official records of the project**.
- (Insert URI Policy on Intellectual rigths)

V. Ethics
- Irrespective of the outcome of the experiment, **ALL THE DATA GENERATED** should be included 
  in the notebook. 
- **Honesty, transparency and communication is the key!!**



_*SUMMARY*_

Follow your PIâ€™s guidelines, and ensure your notebook is a clear, honest, and complete record of your research. Use specific entries, unique naming, and cross-reference supplemental data when necessary.
