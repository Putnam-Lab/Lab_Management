# *Acropora* sp. Fragments Methodology Testing

This specific folder is used for monitoring water quality of the CBLS wetlab tanks for incoming *Acropora* sp. coral fragments from [SeaLife Fish & Aquariums](https://www.facebook.com/SeaLifeAquariums/) in St. Petersburg, FL that will be used for methodological testing. The black quarantine tank will be used to house the coral fragments over the next few months and the water quality measurements need to mimic the host locations specifications. 

Previous coral fragment environmental and water quality conditions, provided by Avalon Langevin, manager at SeaLIfe Fish and Aquariums:

**Salinity**

1.026 specific gravity ~ 34.2 PSU

**Temperature**

76-78 F ~ 24.4-25.5 °C

**PAR**

100-200 PFD daily flux (using apogee)

**Calcium**

420 ppm

**Carbonate Alkalinity**

9.0 dkh


**Fourteen *Acropora* spp. corals recieved on Tuesday January 25th at 11:00 am**

**The aquarist is confident that the green colored coral fragments are *Acropora youngei*, the rest of the coral fragments were choosen as they were morphologically close to *Acropora pulchra* but they could be other species. We think that there are at least four distinct *Acropora* species in this collection.**
