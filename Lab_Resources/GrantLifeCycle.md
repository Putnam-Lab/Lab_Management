# Grant Life Cycle

## Vocab:
1. RFP = request for proposal

## Finding RFPs

2. What are different levels of things I can apply for for the amount of work for the payoff
3. It's always goo to have a one-pager in your back pocket or a "wish-list" with a few paragraph rationale for unexpected rapid funding opportunity
   1. Something you have ready to deliver - a high-level info
4. Strategic about screening RFPs - cost-benefit analysis
   1. Will something take you months to write for only XX amount of money?
5. Solo applications vs collaborative work
   1. Having collaborators helps share the workload, and also helps prove the funder you have the expertise to do a certain protposed project

## Once you have the RFP
1. It is critical to tailor your grant writing to the RFP,
   1. punch the reader in the face why this is the strongest science and best fit for the call for proposals
   2. be strategic in the way you're laying things out
   3. make sure the reader can find what they are evaluating
      1. having the sections they specifically ask for
   4. without paying lip service to the RFP
2. Grantspersonship
   1. What is the thread througout
   2. Can I follow the thread
   3. Have the questions shown up early ecnough to make it clear for the reader
   4. Do figures add to the clarity
   5. Have I shown that I've been able to do these things prior
3. Preliminary data
   1. Think about it like a court case
      1. Is there data you have in hand that can make a case for the fact you can do XYZ so you can do what you are proposing
   2. You can reanalyze data
   3. If you don't have preliminary data, you could set up a theoretical framework (like we did with the JEB paper and used this to propose projects to test those hypotheses and frameworks)
   4. But don't overwhelm the reader with stuff/data
4. Supplementary info
   1. Conflicts of interest
   2. CV and biosketch
   3. Trainee mentoring plan
   4. Equipment available
   5. Physical safety protocol
   6. show access to sites
   7. Permitting 
   8. Letters of support from collegues
   9. Getting paperwork signed by an institution
   10. *the bigger the grant is, the more evidence they want to see*
5.  Other behind the scences work
    1.  There are at least three levels of preapproval within the university for submitting grants
    2.  Fiscal
    3.  office of sponsored projects
    4.  takes time, usually a few weeks before the actual deadline

## Once youre funded

1. Starting logistics, paper trail, data management
2. Data availability standards
3. Meet with project manager ASAP to make sure the money budgeted is in the correct categories you proposed
4. Strategiing where your expenditures come in relative to the major activities
5. Create managmement system for your reporting, qualitative data
   1. Look at what your report will look like at the beginning - what are all the things you need
   2. frontload the work for the reporting as much as possible
6. Create management system to track travel, expenditures, justifications
7. Fiscal reporting - what do you need to do
   1. Ask the funder as early as you can what type of forms the funder needs for fiscal justification
   2. Is there anything we/the university need to track that we aren't yet tracking that the funder will need for reports
8. Planning for time and energy when stuff doesn't go as planned

## As the grant progresses

1. Meet regularly with your grants manager, make sure that all the money is spent

## Closing out grants

1. Takes longer than you think
