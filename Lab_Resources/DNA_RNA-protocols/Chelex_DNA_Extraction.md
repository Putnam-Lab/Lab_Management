## Protocol Steps


###Chelex Preparation
Prepare 5% Chelex  
- Make in small batches of ~45 mL (2.25 g chelex in 45mL of MilliQ H2O)

Pre-heat 5% Chelex solution to 95˚C prior to use for extraction

----------------

### Microcentrifuge tube (1.5mL) protocol   
	- Make sure Chelex is well-mixed and each tube receives chelex resin (the pipet tip should look a little cloudy with Chelex solution)    
-	Always include a negative control tube with no sample

1.	Add sample of tissue to 1.5mL tube
2.	Add 200 µL of pre-heated (95˚C) 5% Chelex
3.	Vortex for 30 sec   
	a.	Make sure tissue is still in the Chelex solution after vortexing
4.	Incubate at 95˚C for 15 minutes, vortexing every 5 min   
	a.	Make sure tissue is still in the Chelex solution after vortexing
5.	Centrifuge for 3 min at 14,000 rpm to pellet Chelex and tissue (benchtop centrifuge)
6.	Pipet ~180 µL of supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube
7.	Centrifuge for 3 min at 14,000 rpm to pellet Chelex and tissue 
8.	Pipet 150 µL of supernatant to a new, labeled 1.5 mL tube
a.	This is the final tube of extracted DNA so label with sample name on the lid and the sample name, extraction date, and initials on the side
b.	Store at 4˚C for immediate use, otherwise store at -20˚C 

----------------
### 0.2ml Strip tube protocol
	- Make sure Chelex is well-mixed and each tube receives chelex resin (the pipet tip should look a little cloudy with Chelex solution)       

1.	Aliquot 100ul of 10% Chelex into 200ul strip tubes (or whatever tubes you’ll be collecting tissue for extraction in). The percent of Chelex doesn’t have to be exactly 10%. It’s difficult to keep it in a homogenous solution while aliquoting, so don’t worry. For very small amounts of tissue 100ul of Chelex solution has worked nicely. If samples are larger, 150uL works well.

2.	Place the sample (about 1-2 verruca) in the tube. Rinse forceps in RO or DI water between samples and dry with kimwipes.

3.	Vortex the tubes (a few seconds) to assure tissue is in the Chelex. 

4.	Using a thermal cycler, incubate at 55°C for 60 minutes followed by 15 minutes at 95°C, hold at 4°C. 

5.	Centrifuge the samples as high as possible (depends on the tubes you use, but try 10,000x g for 2 minutes or as high as available centrifuge goes) to pellet the Chelex. 

6.	You can keep the supernatant with the Chelex resin for transport and storage. However, the coral skeleton will still remain in the tube. For transport, it will be better to very carefully transfer the supernatant (which contains the DNA) into a new tube for transport. Make sure you don’t transfer ANY Chelex; it chelates the Mg2+ required by polymerases and we’ll get no PCR product.

7.	Store in freezer at -20°C. I don’t know how long this will remain good, but sources say anywhere from 3 months to 3 years. So far, we’ve been able to run PCRs on samples when the supernatant was kept with resin at -20°C for >2.5 years.

----------------
### Plate (96-well PCR plate) protocol
-	Make sure Chelex is well-mixed and each tube receives chelex resin (the pipet tip should look a little cloudy with Chelex solution)
-	Always include a negative control well with no sample

1.	Add sample of tissue to each well of the plate and at least 1 well of no sample for a negative control
2.	Add 200 mL of pre-heated (95˚C) 5% Chelex to each well using a monochannel pipet; cap each column with a cap strip
a.	REMEMBER to re-use the same column’s cap strip for each subsequent transfer
3.	Vortex plate for 30 sec by sliding plate back and forth across vortexer
a.	Make sure tissue is still in the Chelex solution after vortexing
4.	Incubate at 95˚C for 15 minutes, vortexing every 5 min
a.	Make sure tissue is still in the Chelex solution after vortexing
5.	Centrifuge for 3 min at 5,600 x g to pellet Chelex and tissue (plate centrifuge)
6.	Pipet ~180 µL of supernatant to each well of a new plate 
7.	Centrifuge for 3 min at 5,600 x g to pellet Chelex and tissue 
8.	Pipet 150 µL of supernatant to a new, labeled PCR plate
a.	This is the final plate with your extracted DNA so label with plate name, extraction date, and initials on the side
b.	Store at 4˚C for immediate use, otherwise store at -20˚C
