## Protocol for testing how to extract High Molecular Weight DNA for Acropora pulchra sperm 

#### Goal:
Use *Acropora pulchra* sperm samples to extract high molecular weight DNA for E5 project *A. pulchra* genome. Testing methods between the Genomic Tip High Molecular Weight DNA Extraction Protocol and NEB High Molecular Weight DNA Extraction.

**Important Notes about HMW DNA** from [Maggie](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/HMW-Tip-Protocol/
)

- HMW DNA is very fragile, pipetting or vortexing can sheer it easily
- Do not vortex after extraction, to mix the samples flick gently then spin down
- Whenever you are pipetting the actual sample (ie, not buffers) you should use wide bore pipette tips, these are next to the kit on the Putnam shelf. They have a larger opening to the tip and are gentler
- **Do not freeze the DNA**, freeze thaws can break up the long fragments, keep HMW DNA in the 4 degree fridge for storage
- HMW DNA can really clump, especially in this extraction method that pellets it in a precipitation. For quantifying with the Qubit, take a top and bottom of the tube 1ul: do 2 Qubits for each sample and average them together for the whole tube concentration

#### Process

1. We will be using *A. pulchra* sperm preserved in Zymo DNA/RNA shield. These samples were preserved by mixing 1 mL of sperm with 1 mL of DNA/RNA shield. 

2. According to the Monarch protocol, the cells (sperm) stored in DNA/RNA shield are already sufficiently lysed:

    > "For samples stored in 2X Monarch DNA/RNA Protection Reagent, cells are already lysed. Dilute the reagent to 1X with nuclease-free water and use this in place of the Nuclei Prep and Lysis Buffer combination for sample lysis. Following the 10-minute incubation with Proteinase K, add RNase A and incubate the sample at 56Â°C for 5 minutes. Subsequently, follow the standard protocol."

    Therefore, we will thaw the sperm in the DNA/RNA shield, and vortex to homogenize/lyse the sperm. Then, since the DNA/RNA shield is already at 1X concentration, we will use this mixture as input for the following steps.

3. Nuclei Prep Buffer preparation
    - Since we used DNA/RNA shield to preserve the sample, we will use DNA/RNA shield instead of the Nuclei Prep Buffer.
    - For one sample, mix 165 uL of cold DNA/RNA shield with 5.5 uL of RNAse A.
    -  **Vortex to mix. Keep on ice.**
    - For more than one sample, refer to the following table:

| Number of Samples | Volume of DNA/RNA Shield (uL) | Volume of RNAse A (uL) |
|-----------------------------|------|----------|
| 1 | 165 | 5.5 |
| 2 | 330 | 11  |
| 3 | 495 | 16.5  |
| 4 | 660 | 22  |
| 5 | 825 | 27.5  |

4. Nuclei Lysis Buffer preparation
    - Since we used DNA/RNA shield to preserve the sample, we will use DNA/RNA shield instead of the Nuclei Lysis Buffer.
    - For one sample, mix 165 uL of cold DNA/RNA shield with 11 uL of Proteinase K.
    -  **Vortex to mix. Keep on ice.**
    - For more than one sample, refer to the following table:

| Number of Samples | Volume of DNA/RNA Shield (uL) | Volume of Proteinase K (uL) |
|-----------------------------|------|----------|
| 1 | 165 | 11  |
| 2 | 330 | 22  |
| 3 | 495 | 33  |
| 4 | 660 | 44  |
| 5 | 825 | 55  |
