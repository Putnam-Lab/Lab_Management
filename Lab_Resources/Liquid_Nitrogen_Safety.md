### Things to know about our LN2 cylinder/LN2 in our lab
- It has a pressure relief valve, if it is making a soft hiss sound, that is normal and it is releasing some pressure. Potentially LN2 tanks loose ~2% of their contents per day just by releasing pressure. This is usually where the pressure gauge is, with a metal valve next to it, however each new tank we get can be different
- Some tanks do not constantly hiss lightly, and instead release a lot of pressure in a loud hiss/pshhh once every hour or few hours. It will last ~5 seconds or so and it should not cause alarm
- If you think there are any issues with the tank, contact your PI and/or lab captain
- If the pressure relief valve is venting loudly for more than 10 seconds, there could be an issue, or it could just need some help venting. You can open the vent valve for a few seconds and then close it again, and try tapping on the pressure relief valve (gently) with a wrench
- If the pressure relief value is frosted up, you can wipe at it with a wet cloth or pour a little water over it to get it to thaw, and then wipe up the water with a cloth
- If there are problems with the tank, you can call AirGas in Warwick 401-732-2920 or the company number for emergencies 1-866-734-3438
- **Putting the hose on tanks**
  - When a new tank comes in, the delivery person will not put the hose back on
  - Push the screw nut all the way back and line up the opening up with the opening on the **LIQUID** valve. Make sure you are using the liquid valve, it is just an opening with no gauge. You have to rest the hose there, it does not latch in or click in any way
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_7188.jpg)
  - Start screwing in the silver nut while trying to keep the hose flush against the opening. It can be really easy to mess up the alignment here. **IF** you are not able to fully screw the nut in all the way with just your fingers, it is not aligned properly and you need to unscrew and try aligning the hose again. This picture is **NOT** a complete screw in:
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/master/images/IMG_7189.jpg)
  - The nut should screw all the way in so that you can't see any threads any more. You should be able to screw it that far with just your fingers. Once you see no threads and can't hand tighten anymore, take a wrench and tighten it **just a tiny bit**. It should barely tighten until you feel total resistance. Do not tighten hard and strip the threads. This is a flush and well-screwed hose:

- **Drawing LN2 from the tank**
  - The hose has a phase separator on the end of it, this causes the hose to make loud "whale" sounds when you start opening the tank valve. This is because you are opening up a super high pressure tank that is immediately turning from liquid to gas. Once the liquid is coming out of the hose (the hose has chilled enough), the sound fades away and the liquid comes out
  - If the hose is making a constant whale screech, the tank is most likely empty
  - It will take a bit of time for the hose to chill down enough for liquid to come out, so **don't crank the valve open wide if there is not liquid coming out immediately**
  - It can be hard to turn the valve on some tanks, using a latex palm glove to get a good grip can be helpful
  - **OPENING A TANK**: Every tank is different. Some tanks require just a tiny turn for any sound to start/gas then liquid release. Other tanks need almost 2 full turns before the valves open. **You must open a tank valve very slowly at first and listen for the whale sounds/releasing gas**
  - When you start hearing the release, stop opening the valve and wait for the hose to chill down and liquid to come out. Then you can adjust how open it is if only a trickle is coming out, you can open it more
  - **Note that when you first start adding in liquid, it will turn to gas immediately because your container is not chilled yet**. It will take a minute or so before you will start to see liquid accumulating even if you see it coming out of the hose
  - Watch [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FZQrLs4ICHgxuS3OcmlR1x4jRo3x7ayp/view?usp=sharing) for the fastest safe speed for liquid to be coming out. **This is not a garden hose**, LN2 coming out fast can splash and burn you severely
  - Monitor the liquid level, position the hose to always be above the liquid line
  - When you're finished, close the valve and let any excess LN2 drip from the hose before removing it from the container you're filling
  - The hose will be super icy, leave it to melt and evaporate on its' own
- It's hard to know exactly how much LN2 is left in a tank, however you can check the pressure gauge, when we get a new tank it is at 20-22psi. There is usually also a little floater measure in the middle of the tank. Sometimes, the floater doesn't move throughout the use of the tank, and the pressure may not change or change minimally. **The best way to know if there is LN2 left is to listen for the sound of the hiss.** If the tank is no longer hissing then the tank is out. Or if it is a loud pshhh-ing tank, when there are no more loud pressure releases, then the tank is empty
- The SDS for LN2 is taped to the wall next to the cylinder
- **You cannot transport liquid nitrogen out of this building, _you especially cannot take any container that has LN2 in it in your car_**. A dry shipper properly charged has no liquid in it, this is for transport. You can only use the small metal thermoflask to move LN2 between rooms/floors of CBLS.  The white tall container can be used to move LN2 between rooms, but it cannot be more than halfway full (does not fully seal). Make sure these containers have their lids closed during transport. These containers are not pressurized, so make sure that they have cooled down before moving, and that the transport is brief. If you're worried about the pressure, stop and open the lid briefly to release pressure. For example, these have been used to get LN2 from the 2nd floor (if we're out), or bring LN2 to lab benches for use in our lab space.

### Questions to Answer
**When you are done, save these responses in a doc or PDF and upload to the [PPP Lab Trainings Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-GkvKIAPjyHMYcQwfDuoZZfON_4pJW19Htjad9_6jw3S_nw/viewform?usp=sf_link)**


1. When using LN2 you should wear eye protection, cryogenic or heavy duty gloves, and long clothes or lab coat. Where in the lab is this PPE located?
2. What are 3 main hazards to liquid nitrogen?
3. Why is it important to add or pour of LN2 slowly from any container?
4. Why can you not travel/move containers with LN2 between buildings or in cars, etc?
5. If you have any questions about LN2 safety or handling, who should you ask?
6. Name one thing you learned that you didn't know previously/was surprising to you.

### Charging dry shippers
- Start charging ~24 hours before needed, this allows for longer charging, and the amount of LN2 left to pour off is usually less (easier to deal with)
- Take the shipper out of the container
- Place the small dry shipper on the step stool to give it more height. For the large dry shippers, use the small scooter cart, this gives it more height and also allows you to wheel it to move it when full of LN2
- If you are using the small dry shipper, take out the insert tube and put in a -80 to keep chilled. Do not fill with the insert inside, they are not designed for that
- Put on cryo gloves or latex palm gloves (you should use the cryo gloves for touching the hose, but sometimes the valve is hard to turn, so the latex palm gloves can be helpful to get an initial grip to open it)
- Take out the lid and put the hose inside the shipper
- Slowly turn the liquid valve open (to the right), there should be loud sounds as the pressure is being released and the hose cools down enough to allow liquid to pass through. **NOTE**, each tank of LN2 is different. Some tanks need only barely a turn before any sound, other tanks require 2 whole turns before anything comes out. Be cautious and turn very slowly if you don't know what the specifics are for this tank
- You will hear sounds at first: this is the gas nitrogen shooting out of the phase separator at the bottom of the hose. The hose needs to chill down before liquid can pass through it. **DO NOT** crank open the valve if liquid doesn't immediately come out, the hose has to get very cold before it can go through
- Wait until you can see liquid coming out of the phase separator before adjusting how much is coming out of the hose. Start slow and adjust up, fast moving LN2 can splash and burn you. Don't have it come out fast though, this can cause pressure to build up inside the dry shipper dangerously, and it can cause a release in pressure inside the cylinder too quickly. See [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FZQrLs4ICHgxuS3OcmlR1x4jRo3x7ayp/view?usp=sharing) for the fastest speed LN2 should be coming out of the hose
- Stay with the dry shipper as you fill it
- Fill until the container is mostly full, **do not fill above the metal inner canister**
- Turn the valve back closed and wait until the hose stops dripping LN2 before removing from inside the shipper
- Put the lid back in the shipper. The small shipper is light enough to be lifted safely and placed back into its' transport box. Slide the box into the empty space near the LN2 tank. The large dry shipper should stay on the push cart, if there is room near the tank you can place it there, otherwise find a low traffic area in the lab to store it overnight
- Use one of the tags that says "DO NOT TOUCH, DRY SHIPPER CHARGING WITH LIQUID NITROGEN" to place on top of the dry shipper so that others in the lab do not touch it
- **Let the shipper charge for ~24 hours if possible**
- When ready to pour off, check the level of LN2 by taking a broom and dipping the handle side into the dry shipper. You will be able to hear the liquid nitrogen boiling when it hits the liquid line
- If using the small dry shipper, it is light enough for 1 person to pour off safely. If using the **large dry shipper, two people must be there to pour off**
- Use the white tall container or a large styrofoam cooler as containers to pour off the LN2 into, do not pour onto the floor
- Make sure you're wearing eye protection and proper clothes/lab coat, and it can be helpful to wear the latex palm gloves for grip
- Have both people have one hand on the handle and one hand under the shipper to lift and pour off the liquid into the container. Communicate and take breaks if needed. The shipper with liquid is probably ~70lbs or more. Be mindful of how you're feeling, and if you feel weird, stop immediately
- Our lab has pretty tall ceilings and is open to the main lab space, but you can also prop open wide the lab door to add extra ventilation
- Pour out all the liquid you can see and set the shipper back on the ground. Wait 10 seconds, then lift and pour again. There will be more liquid that comes out the second time. Set the shipper down, wait, and pour off again a third time. Pour off 3 times to make sure that there is no liquid left in the shipper
- Once empty, you can put the shipper back in the travel case, and the metal insert back into the small shipper
- For the container holding the excess LN2, cover with the lid and place in a well-ventilated place with no traffic (besides the tank is ok, or under an unused bench). Put the red tag that says "DO NOT TOUCH, EXCESS LIQUID NITROGEN" on it. Make sure you put the holder in a place where no one is likely to tip it over
