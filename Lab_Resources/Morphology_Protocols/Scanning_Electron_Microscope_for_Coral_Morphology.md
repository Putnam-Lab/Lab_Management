### Standard Protocol Procedure for using the Scanning Electron Microscope for Coral Imaging

Created by: Putnam Lab 2025-09-26

A detailed training video for this protocol can be found [here](add video file ). It will ask you to request access from a member of the Putnam Lab.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) allows us to provide topographical visualization and distribution of structures we are interested in higher resolution than a regular light micrscope. This protocol is based on the SEM located at the URI Center for Atmospheric Chemistry Studies at GSO Narragansett Bay Campus. 

### Equipment & Lab Materials Details

For obtaining coral imaging following equipments and lab materials are needed at different steps during the procedure from prepping the samples till obtaining the imaging.

# STEPS

### 1. Preservation of coral skeleton

  - The first step to prepare the coral skeleton for imaging is to eliminate any remaining coral tissue from the skeleton.
  - In order to do that put the sample in 10-20% Bleach solution for atleast 24 hours or until there are no traces left of the coral tissue. 
  - Once the coral is ready, it will appear to be white without any traces of pigments on the skeleton.
  - After they have successfully bleached, air dry them for a day/two so they are free of any moisture before proceeding it to the next steps.
    
  ***Note: Make sure if you are preparing multiple samples at a time, label the containers that will clearly indicate the species information to make sure data is accurately used and avoid any potential errors.***

### 2. Drying Specimens/Vacuuming the specimens before SEM imaging
   
The original protocol for this step could be found [here](https://fscucchia-labnotebooks.github.io/FScucchia_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/SEM-prep-Protocol/).

- Make sure before you mount the skeleton, frag the skeleton in a size that can fit in on the aluminium stub. If you are not sure about the sizes, take the aluminium stubs which are stored in the drawer for a reference. 
- Mount skeleton fragment onto a aluminium stub using the black adhesive tape.
  ![Taping the stubs](https://github.com/ppednekar25/Pednekar_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/fe258bd2a4aa69f287772228b5af24aad0dc07eb/images/Forceps%20use%20for%20aluminium%20stubs.JPG?raw=TRUE)
- The adhesive tape is two-sided so make sure you handle it with forceps rather than directly touching the tape or the skeleton.

- Put the mounted sample under vacuum for at least two days. This is a picture of the set up for the vacuum:

- Store the stubs containing the coral skeleton in the SEM box before coating.

  ***Note: Wear gloves and use forceps when handling the coral skeleton as you do not want any oils from your hand to travel onto the stub.***

### 3. Preparing for SEM/Coating

### 4. Gold Coating

### 5. Exposure of structures through SEM
