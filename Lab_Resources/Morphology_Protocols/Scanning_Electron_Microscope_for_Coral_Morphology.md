### Standard Protocol Procedure for using the Scanning Electron Microscope for Coral Imaging

Created by: Putnam Lab 2025-09-26

A detailed training video for this protocol can be found [here](add video file ). It will ask you to request access from a member of the Putnam Lab.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) allows us to provide topographical visualization and distribution of structures we are interested in higher resolution than a regular light micrscope. This protocol is based on the SEM located at the URI Center for Atmospheric Chemistry Studies at GSO Narragansett Bay Campus. 

### Equipment & Lab Materials Details

For obtaining coral imaging following equipments and lab materials are needed at different steps during the procedure from prepping the samples till obtaining the imaging.

 ### Equipments
- Vacuum Desiccator

- Rocker Vacuum Pump 
 
- Denton Vacuum Desk V Coater System

- ThermoScientific Phenom XL G3 Desktop SEM

### Lab Materials

 - Fine Tipped Tweezers

 - Grip/Locking Tweezers

 - Pair of Gloves

 - Black adhesive tabs

## STEPS for obtaining Coral Imaging

### 1. Preservation of coral skeleton

  - The first step to prepare the coral skeleton for imaging is to eliminate any remaining coral tissue from the skeleton.
  - In order to do that put the sample in 20% Bleach solution for atleast 24 hours or until there are no traces left of the coral tissue. 
  - Once the coral is ready, it will appear to be white without any traces of pigments on the skeleton.
  - After they have successfully bleached, air dry them for a day or two so they are free of any moisture before proceeding it to the next steps.
    
  ***Note: Make sure if you are preparing multiple samples at a time, label the containers that will clearly indicate the species information to make sure data is accurately used and avoid any potential errors.***

### 2. Vacuuming the specimens before SEM imaging

This step is initial for getting rid off any remaining organic, inorganic contaminants which could interfere during the SEM imaging as well as create hinderance during the coating of the sample skeletons.
   
The original protocol for this step could be found [here](https://fscucchia-labnotebooks.github.io/FScucchia_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/SEM-prep-Protocol/).

*Equipment: Rocker Vacuum Pump and Vacuum Dessicator*

[Vacuum Dessicator](https://www.grainger.com/product/8ZCA7?gucid=N:N:PS:Paid:GGL:CSM-2295:6VHHZD:20500801:APZ_1&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21369464100&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3OjGBhDYARIsADd-uX7pEzFNw7odNmHNI-a-IM7W5-HvP-oID10aHXReK7re8K-_xemL9xkaAsuKEALw_wcB)

Rocker Vacuum Pump

 - Make sure before you mount the skeleton, frag the skeleton in a size that can fit in on the aluminium stub. If you are not sure about the sizes, take the aluminium stubs which are stored in the drawer for a reference. 

 - Place the microscope-specific almuniun stub in the storage box and mount the black adheseive tape on it with the help of fine-tipped tweezers.
  ![Taping the stubs](https://github.com/ppednekar25/Pednekar_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/fe258bd2a4aa69f287772228b5af24aad0dc07eb/images/Forceps%20use%20for%20aluminium%20stubs.JPG?raw=TRUE)
  *Note:The adhesive tape is double-sided so make sure you handle it with forceps rather than directly touching the tape or the skeleton.*

 - Place the fixed and dried skeleton on the stub. After placing, make sure the specimen is firmly attached to the stub. 

 - Now each of the stubs, could be mounted in the vacuum dessicator. This is a picture of the set up for the vacuum:

 - Turn on the vacuum and let the samples stay in the dessicator for 2-3 days. 

 - Store the stubs containing the coral skeleton in the SEM box before transporting to the coater.

  ***Note: Wear gloves and use forceps when handling the coral skeleton as you do not want any oils from your hand to travel onto the stub.***

### 3. Preparing for SEM/Coating

 If you have not mounted the coral skeleton on the stubs during Step 2, and used different means to vacuum them make sure you repeat the same steps for coral mounting before initiating the coating process. 

### 4. Sputter Gold Coating of the coral skeleton

**Objective: Apply a thin (10 nm) gold coating to specimens for secondary electron (SE) imaging in the SEM.**

*Equipment: Denton Vacuum Desk V coater system*
   ![Denton Coater Part](https://github.com/ppednekar25/Pednekar_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/aa9e115bcea88c47c875f425aa22cd37e093908d/images/Denton%20Coater.JPG?raw=ZTURE)
   ![Denton Vacuum](https://github.com/ppednekar25/Pednekar_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/aa9e115bcea88c47c875f425aa22cd37e093908d/images/Denton%20Vacuum.JPG?raw=TRUE)

   1. Make sure the coater is fitted with the SHORT glass cylinder, which is the correct height for the gold sputter head the head attached to the coater body that hinges open.
   2. Open the gold super head if it is closed. It should pivot on a hinge to a resting position to the left of the coating chamber.
   3. Place samples on the coating platform
   4. Inspect the rubber o-ring on the top of the short glass cylinder. If you see any dust, use alcohol on a kimwipe to clean it off.
   5. Make sure the cylinder is centered so that the sputter head covers it completely, and close the sputter head over the top of the cylinder.
   6. Tap the touch screen on the front of the body to wake it up.
   7. Press the "Screens" button to bring up a panel with sputtering options.
   8. Choose "Timed Sputter"
   9. Set the sputter amperage and process time to desired values. For a 10 nm coating, choose 40 mA and 34 seconds.
   10. If it is red, press the "Vent After Sputter Enabled" button to turn it green. If the button is already green, you do not need to press it. This will automatically turn off the vacuum pump after the sputter time is complete.
   11. Don protective eyewear. The lab has two pairs of protective goggles - one fits directly over the eyes (has elastic strap), the other will slip on over eyeglasses.
   12. Press the button for "Timed Sputter Enable" to start pumping down the vacuum in the sputter chamber. It will pump down to a pressure of 4-5 x 10-2 Torr before automatically sputtering at the set amperage for the set duration of time. This can take ~5-10 minutes.
   13. You can press the "Overview" button to see a live read back of the pressure in the chamber.
   14. Once the vacuum pump turns off automatically, you can remove your eye protection.
   15. Test the sputter head to see if it is loose enough to swing into its rest position. If the pressure in the chamber is still too low, just wait a few seconds and try again. When it moves freely, swing the head to its rest position.
   16. Remove your samples from the platform. It may be easier to lift the cylinder off before removing your samples. Please replace the cylinder on the coater after removing your samples, and swing the sputter head back into its closed position.
   17. All done!

### 5. Exposure of structures through SEM
