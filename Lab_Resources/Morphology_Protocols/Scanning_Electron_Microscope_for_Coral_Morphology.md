A detailed training video for this protocol can be found here. It will ask you to request access from a member of the Putnam Lab.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) allows us to provide topographical visualization and distribution of structures we are interested in higher resolution than a regular light micrscope. This protocol is based on the SEM located at the URI Center for Atmospheric Chemistry Studies Building at GSO Narragansett Bay Campus.
