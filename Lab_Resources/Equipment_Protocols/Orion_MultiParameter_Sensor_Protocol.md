<a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**

<a name="NBS"></a> **NBS Calibration**  
1. Calibrating pH
1. pH should be calibrated <24 hours before use.
1. Fill a small clean beaker with DI water, and pour the three calibration solutions (pH of 4, 7, and 10) into three clean beakers, and place near your work station.
1. Turn on the meter and wait for the measurement screen to appear.
1. Make sure the current measurement is for pH.  If not, Either change the Channel (press F3 to swap between probe inputs) or Mode (pressing the Mode button on the meter to swap between measurements using the current Channel's probe) until the instrument is reading pH.
1. Press F1 to select "cal" and go into Calibration settings.  You should see a prompt screen for the meter to read the first calibration solution.
1. Remove the probe from the storage solution
1. First unscrew the lid from the small storage container.
1. Once the probe and storage cap are able to be lifted from the storage container, slide the cap off the probe.
1. Rinse the probe in DI water to remove any storage solution, and dry the probe (but not the sensor tip) with a chem wipe.
1. Place the probe into the pH 4 solution, fully submerging the sensor tip, and agitate the probe tip back and forth briefly.
1. Press F2 to Start the first calibration and wait for the reading to stabilize.
1. The probe should read 4.01 at the lab's ambient temperature of 22-23 &deg; C
1. Once the reading has stabilized at a reasonable value, press F2 for the Next calibration.
1. Rinse the probe in DI and dry with a chem wipe (again avoiding the sensor tip) before placing the probe in the pH 7 solution, and then agitate the probe tip back and forth briefly.
1. Wait for a stable reading (7.01 at 22-23 &deg; C) then press F2 for the Next calibration.
1. Rinse the probe in DI and dry with a chem wipe (again avoiding the sensor tip) before placing the probe in the pH 10 solution, and then agitate the probe tip back and forth briefly.
1. Wait for a stable reading (10.04 at 22-23 &deg; C) then press F3 to Finish calibration.
1. If you are satisfied with the three calibration values on the summary screen, press F1 to return to the Measurement screen.
1. Calibrating Conductivity
<a name="Cleaning and Storage"></a> 1. Cleaning and Storage
1. When you have finished using the meter, thoroughly rinse all probes, especially sensor tips, with DI water.
1. Dry probes (avoiding sensor tips) with chem wipes.
1. pH probe
1. Unscrew the storage container cap from the container, and slide the cap onto the probe shaft, far enough that the sensor tip will be submerged in the storage solution, but not so far that the cap will not full screw onto the container.
1. If needed, refill the storage solution.
1. Place the probe into the container and screw on the cap.
1. Check to make sure the sensor tip is fully submerged.
1. **Do not** try to force the sensor tip further into the solution while the cap is screwed on or you may damage the probe.

<a name="Tris"></a> **Tris Calibration**  
1. Calibrating pH
1. pH should be calibrated <48 hours before use.
1. Fill a small clean beaker with DI water and fill about half of a 50mL falcon tube with fresh Tris Buffer (from Scripps CO2 Lab). 
1. If a tris buffer has already been allocated within the previous 3 weeks and properly sealed and stored in the fume hood, you may use this solution for the calibration.
1. Place the sealed falcon tube in a container to keep it mostly  upright.
1. place the electrode into the tris tube.
1. Place the Traceable Thermometer probe tip into the small hole of the cap and slide down to the same level as the pH electrode.  Turn on the Thermometer.
1. Turn on the meter and wait for the measurement screen to appear.
1. Make sure the current measurement is for mV.  If not, either change the Channel (press F3 to swap between probe inputs) or Mode (pressing the Mode button on the meter to swap between measurements using the current Channel's probe) until the instrument is reading mV.
1. Plan to record the temperature and mV values for every temperature spanning one degree Ceclius above and below the temperature range you expect to record in situ.
1. Record mV and temperature for at least 5 temperatures to create a best fit curve.
1. Fill the container in which the falcon tube of tris is sitting with sink water.
1. Move the pH electrode and thermometer with cap to the falcon tube containing tris, wiping both probes before placing in the falcon tube and screwing the cap on. 
1. If your highest planned temperature value is greater than the ambient tris temperature, warm up the container of sink water in the microwave and then place the tris falcon tube into this water bath.
1. If your highest planned temperature value is lower than the ambient tris temperature, place a few ice chips into the water bath.
1. Watch the thermometer temperature as it rises or falls, and when the temperature is near your target upper temperature, press Measure on the Orion and wait for the value to stabilize (attempt to time the mV reading stabilization as close to a rounded temperature value on the thermometer as possible).
1. As soon as the Orion value has stabilized, record the thermometer temperature first, then the mV value (note that mV values should be negative).
1. To lower the temperature to each subsequent temperature in your calibration, place a few ice chips at a time in the water bath and record each temperature with its paired mV value.
1. Once you have recorded the lowest temperature and its paired mV value, unscrew the cap with probes from the tris falcon tube and place the probes back into the DI falcon tube, screwing the cap back on if you intend to record your in situ values immediately.  If you will not be recording your in situ values yet, remove the pH probe from the cap and place the electrode tip back in its storage solution until ready to record.
1. Save your temperature and mV values as a .csv file with the following column headings (without quotes): "date", "TTris", and "mVTris"
1. Measurements
1. When recording your values in situ, always record the temperature first from the Traceable Thermometer before the stabilized mV value from the Orion.
1. In tandem with recording the temperature and mV of your water sample, also record the salinity and save three three metrics with your sample ID's in a .csv file with the following column headings (without quotes): "date", "SampleID", "Salinity_lab", "mV", "TempInSitu"
1. Use the calibration file created above and this in situ file to calculate pH on the Total Scale using the [Tris_pH_Slope.R script](https://github.com/SilbigerLab/Protocols/blob/master/Probe_and_Logger_Protocols/Orion_Multiparameter_Sensor/Scripts/Tris_pH_Slope.R)

<a name="Conductivity"></a> **Conductivity Calibration** 

1. Press the f1 (cal) key to start the calibration.
1. Rinse the conductivity sensor and any other electrodes in use with DI water and wipe gently with a Kimwipe.
1. Place sensor into the first conductuctivity standard (12.9 mS/cm) and press the f3 (start) key.
1. Wait for the value on the meter to stabilize and perform one of the following actions:
    1. Press the f2 (accept) key to accept the conductivity value 
    1. Press the f3 (edit) key to access the popup number entry screen and manually enter the conductivity standard value expected at the measured temperature.
            - Press the p, q, t or u key to highlight a number or decimal point, press the f3 (enter) key to select the highlighted item and repeat until the desired value is shown at the top of the screen.
            - Press the f2 (done) key to save the value and exit the number entry screen.
            - Press the f2 (accept) key to accept the manually entered value.
1. Press the f2 (next) key to proceed to the next standard and repeat steps 2 through 4 for the second conductovity standard (1413 μS/cm).
1. Press the f3 (cal done) key to save and end the calibration.
1. Press the f1 (meas) key to proceed to the measurement mode.

<a name="Salinity"></a> **Salinity Calibration** 
- the conductivity probe is used to measure salinity and must be calibrated once weekly at 25°C
1. Gently use a Kim wipe to dry the tip of the conductivity probe 
1. Press the f3 (channel) key to navigate to the salinity measurement channel start the calibration
1. While still on the salinity measurement channel, press the f1 (cal) key
1. hold salinity standard (50,000us/cm) by the top of the Falcon tube to minimize heat transfer to the calibration standard and using the temperature probe measure temperature
1. adjust temperature of the salinity calibration fluid to 25°C by *slowly* applying heat from your hands by holding and lightly squeezing the tube to increase the temperature or cupping the tube with ice pack to decrease the temperature
1. at 25°C, place probe into conductivity fluid and allow measurement to stablize 
1. record first reading in binder
        - for example: "calibrated salinity probe with 50.00ms/cm conductivity standard; 48.71 ms/cm upon first reading"
1. if first reading is not 50.00 ms/cm, press f3 (edit) and enter 50.00 for the standard and record average cell calibration factor in binder
        - for example: "calibrated to 50.00ms/cm at 25°C; avg. cell cal. factor = 0.477"
1. Optional: to check if the conductivity probe may need replacement or fixing, you can also measure the salinity of clean DI water (psu = ~0)

<a name="Cleaning_and_Storage"></a> **Cleaning and Storage** 

1. After use of any of the meters, gently wipe the meters and accompanying wires with a kimwipe and DI water (avoid electrical connections).
        - If storing for a long period of time, use a diluted ethanol solution and kimwipe to wipe down wires and Orion Star meter to remove any salt that may have accumulated (avoid electrical connections).
        
1. pH meter storage
        - Always store the pH meter submerged in a solution, the special conductive glass coating shouldn’t be left to dry out.
        - After each use store the pH meter in its accompanying sealed tight tube or a falcon tube if necessary that is filled with KCl solution or pH buffer 4.0 if KCl solution is unavailable.
        - **never use distilled or deionized water, as prolonged submersion in water can encourage diffusion out of the electrode, which will affect its sensitivity**
        
1. Conductivity meter storage
        - In between uses, store the conductivity meter in a falcon tube with Type I DI water.  
        - When packing away for long-term storage, the conductivity meter can be stored dry in the Orion Star Meter plastic black case.
        
1. Long-term storage
- After properly cleaning all meters and following the above storage solution methods, store all materials into the Orion Star Meter plastic black case as seen below:
