**Materials:**  

- [Easy Elmasonic Sonicator](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/44ac13151b0981740158e9ffe74489acade21692/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Equip_Images/Sonicator.jpg)
- [Transformer](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/44ac13151b0981740158e9ffe74489acade21692/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Equip_Images/Simran_Transformer.jpg)
 

**Protocol Steps**
1. The Easy Elmasonic Sonicator has a 220V outlet intended for use in Mo'orea, have to use a transformer to convert the voltage from 110V to 220V safely.

***Follow the [transformer protocol] (https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/f3f00e5e0fedf8fbb0813b55df9a57ddaa9bf925/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Simran_Transformer_Protocol.md) carefully and make sure there is no liquid around the transformer***

2. Plug the transformer into a 110V outlet and read the instructions carefully. Change the INPUT to the transformer to 110V (this step is extremely important, make sure the voltage you plug the transfromer into matches the INPUT tab located in the back of the transformer).

3. With the transformer turned to OFF, plug in the sonicator into the 220V outlet on the transformer and turn the transformer to ON.

4. Following the [sonicator instruction manual](http://redstarvietnam.com/media/lib/ba_elmasonic_easy_en.pdf), I fill the sonicator 2/3rds of the way with freshwater (~2,000 mL). 
    - This specific sonicator does not have a way to change the frequency settings, you can only adjust the time it runs for and the temperature it runs at.

5. If you want to use this sonicator for endosymbiont cells, see [Danielle Beckers Notebook Post](https://github.com/daniellembecker/DanielleBecker_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-03-04-Ariana-Mcap2020-EarlyLifeHistory-Samples.md)
